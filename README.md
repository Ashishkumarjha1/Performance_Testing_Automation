Performance Automation Testing
This project automates the performance testing process for an alarm system by leveraging various tools and techniques to streamline testing, improve accuracy, and reduce testing time.

Features
Excel Integration: Reads performance testing details directly from an Excel sheet.

Camera Management: Starts and controls cameras via API calls for video-based alarm system testing.

Alarm Capture: Captures alarms triggered during tests and stores them in a centralized database.

Accuracy Assessment: Compares generated alarms with actual timestamps to compute precision and recall.

Performance Metrics: Reduces testing time through automation.

High Accuracy: The system has demonstrated high accuracy in matching generated alarms with actual timestamps.
